In order for a bug to be fixed, we need a good description of the problem. Therefore we ask that you follow these steps when reporting a bug:

    - make a detailed step by step guide so that someone else can reproduce the problem (this is, so that this person gets the same behavior that you get from the code when running on a different pc)
    - be clear about what the expected behavior for the code is.
    - attach figures or screenshots if they add info
    - if the error happens with some specific data set but not others, attach the data or a link to the data if it is in the server
    - Mention the version of the code that you are using!
